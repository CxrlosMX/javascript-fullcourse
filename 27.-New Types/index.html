    <h1>Symbols</h1>
    <p>Symbols are new primitive type introduced in ES6. Symbols are completely unique identifiers. Just like their primitive counterparts (Number, String, Boolean),<br> they can be created using the factory function Symbol() which returns a Symbol. Every time you call the factory function, a new and unique symbol is created</p>
    <h1>Set</h1>
    <p>Sets are a new object type included in ES6 that allow the creation of collections of unique values. The values in a set can be either simple primitives like strings and integers or more complex object types like object literals or arrays. Think of sets as an array with no repeated elements</p>
